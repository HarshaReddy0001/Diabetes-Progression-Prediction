# Diabetes Progression Prediction

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to analyze a diabetes dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and build a predictive model for disease progression with the ultimate aim of identifying key factors influencing diabetes progression and potentially aiding in early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the diabetes dataset available at [https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/LARS/diabetes.data](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/LARS/diabetes.data). This dataset consists of measurements on 442 patients with diabetes, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and six serum measurements (S1-S6), along with a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline (Y).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involved:
- Checking for missing values (none found).
- Exploring unique values and data types.
- Analyzing descriptive statistics.
- Identifying and handling outliers using the Z-score method.
- Visualizing data distributions using histograms and violin plots.
- Examining correlations between features using a heatmap.

**Key Findings from EDA:**
- Strong positive correlations were observed between S1 and S2, BMI and BP, and S4 and S5.
- BMI showed a significant positive correlation with the target variable (Y), indicating that higher BMI is associated with more severe diabetes progression.
- S3 showed a negative correlation with several features, including the target variable.

## Feature Importance
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated to assess multicollinearity among features. High VIF values were observed for S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, suggesting multicollinearity within these serum measurements.

Feature importances were also calculated using a Random Forest model. The most important features for predicting diabetes progression (Y) were:
- BMI
- S5
- BP
- S6

## Predictive Modeling
A Random Forest Regressor model was trained to predict diabetes progression (Y).

**Model Performance:**
- The R-squared value of the model was 0.44, indicating that approximately 44% of the variance in diabetes progression can be explained by the features in the model.
- The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was approximately 2953.62.

## Results and Conclusion
The analysis revealed that BMI, S5, BP, and S6 are the most influential factors in predicting diabetes progression based on this dataset. While the Random Forest model achieved an R-squared of 0.44, suggesting moderate predictive power, there is room for improvement. The presence of multicollinearity among some features (S1-S5) might impact the model's interpretability and could be addressed in future work through feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Business Use and Impact
This project has significant business implications, particularly in the healthcare sector:

- **Early Intervention:** By identifying key factors influencing diabetes progression, healthcare providers can prioritize interventions for patients at higher risk, potentially slowing down the disease's advancement.
- **Personalized Treatment:** Understanding the impact of different features on progression can help tailor treatment plans to individual patients, leading to more effective outcomes.
- **Resource Allocation:** Hospitals and clinics can optimize resource allocation by focusing on managing patients with identified high-risk factors.
- **Pharmaceutical Research:** The insights gained from feature importance can guide pharmaceutical research and development towards targeting the most impactful biological pathways.
- **Health and Wellness Programs:** The findings can inform the design of public health campaigns and wellness programs aimed at addressing key risk factors like BMI and blood pressure.

By leveraging predictive models and data-driven insights, healthcare companies can improve patient care, reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with severe diabetes complications, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.
